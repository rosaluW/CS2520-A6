The goal of this team assignment is to refactor file "graphics_v4.py" of a Soccer Pygame project, designing the code to become more modular and easily maintanable. Additionally, the code must be refactored to ensure easy readability for future readers and developers.
The assignment is also designed to practice effective collaboration and communication through GitHub services.

****************************************************************************************************************
To get started, you will need to create a fork of the original project and then work collaboratively to refactor the codebase. You will need to think carefully about how you structure the code to ensure it is modular and easy to maintain. Additionally, you will need to ensure that the code adheres to best practices and coding conventions to ensure it is easily understandable by others.

An important aspect of this assignment is the application of structural programming techniques. You will need to edit the program in a functional form, focusing on organizing your code into clear, concise, and reusable functions that can be easily combined and modified as needed.

Throughout the assignment, you will be expected to communicate effectively with your group members using Git as a version control system. Git will help you collaborate on the project, track changes, and resolve conflicts that may arise during the development process. At the end of the assignment, you will need to publish your final project on a GitHub page, making sure to include all necessary documentation and a clear README file.

By the end of the assignment, you should have a well-organized and easily modifiable codebase that can be adapted to meet a range of requirements or design preferences, utilizing structural programming techniques for efficient and functional code. Remember, you can form groups of 2 to 4 students for this assignment, depending on your preferences and the availability of your classmates.
